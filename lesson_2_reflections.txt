when you initialize a repository a .git directory is created that 
contains the history of the files in the directory.
we initialize a git repository to create versions of the files in
the directory.

The staging area is  different from the working directory and
the repository in the way that it only allows files to be grouped
to create a commit

we use git add to add a logical change to the staging area and then
git commit to commit to the repository

we use branches when we want to try out something new but we want 
a version we can revert to easily

Drawing diagrams help visualize the branch structure and prevent accidental loss of commits
